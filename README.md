# Compare 3 learning methods to recognize fake notes, based on a dataset composed of 4 feture
This is a part of a project done at the University of Lisbon - FCT - UNL (Portougal), class of Machine Learning 2018/19.
We compare three different classificatory (logistic regression, K Nearest Neighbors, NaiÌˆve Bayes) to classify real and fake banknotes using features (Variance, Skewness, Curtosis and Entropy).
The data was taken from the Machine Learning Repository website (Lohweg, 2012). The dataset was extracted from genuine and forges banknotes and consists of images of the banknotes. The features are: Variance, Skewness, Curtosis, and Entropy.

### Prerequisites

Python 3 

Packages used: matplotlib, sklearn, numpy

## Deployment

The logisitc regression and k nearest neighbours used are from scikit-learn python package. We apply over them only a cross-validation method to retrieve the best values for our purpose.
Then we implemented the Naive Bayse clissifier without using any external plugin. We did that using kernel density estimators to evaluate each feature and the apply to it the naive bayse theory.

##  Important steps during implementation

We first look at the feature distribution using th KDE's function furnished from scikit-learn. 
With the graph below we see a cool visualization of the data to understaing the distribution of out dataset.
